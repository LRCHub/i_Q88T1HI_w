You've been such a good friend
I've known you since I don't know when
We've got lots of friends,
But they come and go
Even though we've never said it,
There's something that the two of us both know

Together, forever no matter how long
From now, until the end of time
We'll be together, and you can be sure
That forever and a day
That's how long we'll stay
Together and forever more

Always gone that extra mile
Depended on you all the while
Even in the good and bad times
You will see
From now until our journey's end
You know you can always count on me

Together, forever no matter how long
From now, until the end of time
We'll be together, and you can be sure
That forever and a day
That's how long we'll stay
Together and forever more

No matter where our destiny leads
I'll be there for you, always come through
And that you can believe

C'mon you guys, I've gotta get another badge!
You'd better figure out how to repay me
For my broken bike, Ash Ketchum!
Oh no, not this again.
Pikachu.

Together, forever no matter how long
From now, until the end of time
We'll be together, and you can be sure
That forever and a day
That's how long we'll stay
Together and forever more
Together, forever no matter how long
From now, until the end of time
We'll be together, and you can be sure
That forever and a day
That's how long we'll stay
Together, forever no matter how long
From now, until the end of time
We'll be together, and you can be sure...
