I'm your tamagotchi
So happy that you love me
And we should be together
Forever and forever
Cause I'm your tamagotchi
I need you to protect me
So that in the night I can feel alright
I'm your tamagotchi
So happy that you love me
And we should be together
Forever and forever
Cause I'm your tamagotchi
I need you to protect me
So that in the night I can feel alright
I see you as my new Mom and Daddy
If you will feed and nurse me I'm happy
The two of us will take care of each other
All that I do, I will do for you
I'm your tamagotchi
So happy that you love me
And we should be together
Forever and forever
Cause I'm your tamagotchi
I need you to protect me
So that in the night I will feel alright
Oh ee oh ee yum bum, oh ee yum bum
Oh ee oh ee yum bum, oh ee yum bum
Oh ee oh ee yum bum, oh ee yum bum

All I need is a sister and brother
Cause I'm alone in my world, there's no other
Then we, the three of us would be together
And all that we do, we will do for you
I'm your tamagotchi
So happy that you love me
And we should be together
Forever and forever
Cause I'm your tamagotchi
I need you to protect me
So that in the night I can feel alright

Yeah! But I gotta go, gotta go!
I'm your tamagotchi
So happy that you love me
And we should be together
Forever and forever
Cause I'm your tamagotchi
I need you to protect me
So that in the night I can feel alright
Oh ee oh ee yum bum, oh yum bum
