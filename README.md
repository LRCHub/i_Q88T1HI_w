[00:19.62] If there's anything you need
[00:23.13] All you have to do is say
[00:25.99] You know you satisfy everything in me
[00:31.28] We shouldn't waste a single day
[00:46.78] 
[00:35.57] So don't stop me falling
[00:37.65] It's destiny calling
[00:39.70] A power I just can't deny
[00:44.03] It's never-changing
[00:45.94] Can't you hear me, I'm saying
[00:48.16] I want you for the rest of my life
[01:05.16] 
[00:52.29] Together forever and never to part
[00:56.48] Together forever we two
[01:00.50] And don't you know
[01:01.69] I would move Heaven and Earth
[01:04.26] To be together forever with you
[01:19.76] 
[01:09.74] If they ever get you down
[01:13.19] There's always something I can do
[01:16.30] Because I wouldn't ever wanna see you frown
[01:21.33] I'll always do what's best for you
[01:38.33] 
[01:25.60] There ain't no mistaking
[01:27.76] It's true love we're making
[01:29.89] Something to last for all time
[01:34.07] It's never-changing
[01:35.89] Can't you hear me, I'm saying
[01:38.14] I want you for the rest of my life
[01:55.14] 
[01:42.10] Together forever and never to part
[01:46.21] Together forever we two
[01:50.69] And don't you know
[01:51.71] I would move Heaven and Earth
[01:54.22] To be together forever with you
[02:09.72] 
[02:15.50] So don't stop me falling
[02:17.83] It's destiny calling
[02:19.85] A power I just can't deny
[02:24.20] It's never-changing
[02:25.93] Can't you hear me, I'm saying
[02:28.12] I want you for the rest of my life
[02:45.12] 
[02:32.35] Together forever and never to part
[02:36.43] Together forever we two
[02:40.66] And don't you know
[02:42.00] I would move Heaven and Earth
[02:44.39] To be together forever with you
[02:59.89] 
[02:48.95] Together forever and never to part
[02:53.18] Together forever we two
[02:57.39] And don't you know
[02:58.35] I would move Heaven and Earth
[03:01.04] To be together forever with you
[03:16.54] 
[03:05.74] Together forever and never to part
[03:09.84] Together forever we two
[03:14.04] And don't you know
[03:15.38] I would move Heaven and Earth
[03:17.64] To be together forever with you
